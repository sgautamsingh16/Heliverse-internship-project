My approach for the backend assignment
I first created a login/register for user to add them in our database or retriev information from them and loggedin them.
I created a sql database with register to store the information and retrieve them accordingly.
I connected my flask app with sql database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

After logging in the user will have two options either take a quiz or create one.
to create user will have to enter quiz question options and start and end date.
to take a quiz the database will retrieve available quiz  and if you want to take one.
